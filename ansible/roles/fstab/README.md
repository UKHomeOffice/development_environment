# Secure FileSystem Deployment

These ansible scripts are free to use and follow where possible best practice guidence from the security community. Please feel free to fork this repository for your own needs and also submit pull requests to enhance or harden where approptiate.

All modules included here should work as a minimum under xfce4 with either an Ubuntu or RedHat/CentOS base image. For Ubuntu the compatability checks start at 16.04 where as for RedHat/CentOS it also supports 6.7 along with 7 and above however, continuing support for 6.7 is not required so long as the module checks to only install on OS's of a higher version.

This module uses the fstab to set permissions for different filesystems, the defaults follow best practice mounts.
