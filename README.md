```

If you want to use a different branch then replace the word `develop` in the URL and the `TAG` variable with the name of the branch you wish to use.

### Setting up the proxy
Running the PXE server requires setting up a proxy. First, make sure the IP address specified in the Makefile is one that your local machine has on e.g. an ethernet connection. Then clone the following git repository:

```
https://github.com/keaosolutions/docker-proxy-cache
```

Finally, start the proxy server by running the following commands in the new directory:

    make run

This builds and runs a local proxy with port 3128 exposed to your local network, please then update the Makefile for the development_environment project to have your local IP address as the proxy server.
